# Plant-Disease-Detection

Disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture as farmers have often to decide whether the crop they are harvesting is good enough. It is of utmost importance to take these seriously as it can lead to serious problems in plants due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. Plant diseases cause a periodic outbreak of diseases leading to large-scale death which severely affects the economy. These problems need to be solved at the initial stage, to save the lives and money of people. Automatic classification of plant diseases is an important research topic as it is important in monitoring large fields of crops and at a very early stage, if we can detect the symptoms of diseases when they appear on plant leaves. This enables computer vision algorithms to provide image-based automatic inspection. Comparatively, manual identification is labor intensive, less accurate and can be done only in small areas at a time. By this method, the plant diseases can be identified at the initial stage itself and the pest and infection control tools can be used to solve pest problems while minimizing risks to people and the environment.
